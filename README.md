# PatternRecognition
This  repository includes 5 Pattern Recognition Projects. The codes are written in Matlab.

# Project-1:
In this project, we experiment with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Fischer Linear Discriminant. 

# Project-2:
In this part, we implement the Bayes rule for classification. The class-conditional probabilities (likelihoods), which are assumed to be in Gaussian distribution, are estimated.

# Project-3:
Similar to the previous part, we again make a classification by using Bayes rule. This time, we assume that the mean of a likelihoods is another random variable, and we estimate it by maximum likelihood estimation.

# Project-4:
In this part, we use Parzen Window and K-nearest Neighbor estimation methods.

# Project-5:
In the last part, we implement single-sample Perceptron model and Ho-Kashyap algorithm for the estimation.
