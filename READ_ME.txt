---- Q1_d_prime_selection.m generates Figure 1, nothing more. It can take like 5 minutes.

---- Q1_errors_for_classes.m finds the errors of different classes for the d_prime=50. It basically generates the answer of Q1. 

---- Q2.m generates the c-by-c matrices and the 1D projection plots for each of the 7 projection vectors.
